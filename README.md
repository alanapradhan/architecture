Agile rules:

Individuals and Interactions over Processes and Tools
Working Software over Comprehensive Documentation
Customer Collaboration over Contract Negotiation, and
Responding to Change over Following a Plan

**What to do:**

Find out where you are
Take a small step towards your goal
Adjust your understanding based on what you learned
Repeat

**How to do it:**

When faced with two or more alternatives that deliver roughly the same value, take the path that makes future change easier.
